# About the Media Mapper

## What is it?

The Media Mapper is an open source framework intended to be used as a starting point for building a web application geared towards exploring Media throughout time and space.

The project was dreamt up by **Ennuri Jo** as a way to explore the relationship between media and water. Funding for this project was provided by the [University of Pennsylvania, Penn](https://www.upenn.edu/). The framework was developed by Ben Tyler and (Lost Creek Designs](https://lostcreekdesigns.co/).
